[Ema](https://github.com/srid/ema) is a next-gen **Haskell** library toolkit for building [jamstack-style](https://jamstack.org/) static sites. Ema sites are *change-aware*; in addition to good ol' static site generation, it provides a live server supporting **fast hot-reload** in the browser on code *or* data change. 

{.text-gray-600}
The ultimate goal of ema is to facilitate creating with ease your own [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), or just about any app that creates a browser view of arbitrarily changing data (on disk, database, or whatever). Ema is designed to facilitate creation of apps whose data is normally *edited* via traditional mechanisms (eg: text editor) but *rendered* as a delightful web page - so as to provide an economical read-only view of your data on desktop & mobile.
