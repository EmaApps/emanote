# Helpers

Beyond the model and route types, Ema leaves it up to you as to how to develop your site. The following are not *required* when using Ema; nevertheless they are useful inasmuch as they capture common patterns in writing a good static site:

* [Tailwind + Blaze](guide/helpers/tailwind.md) -- [We recommend--but not mandate--Tailwind for CSS and blaze-html as HTML DSL]{.item-intro}
* [Working with files](guide/helpers/filesystem.md) -- [Ema provides a helper to support hot-reload on files]{.item-intro}
* [Converting Markdown](guide/helpers/markdown.md) -- [Pointers on how to work with Markdown files]{.item-intro}
